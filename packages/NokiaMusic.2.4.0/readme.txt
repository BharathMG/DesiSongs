The Nokia Music API lets you easily integrate your Windows Phone application with Nokia Music on Nokia Lumia phones or your Windows Store app with Nokia Music for Windows 8.

The API offers two levels of integration; the simplest and quickest to get going is to use the high-level Launcher Tasks,
with more advanced integration available to perform searches and get recommendations within your app.

Please link back to Nokia Music from your app!
